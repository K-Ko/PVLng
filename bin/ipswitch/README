IPSwitch offers sensors and actors managed using HTTP and other sources.

Some input ports can be used for S0 counting. It can manage S0 impules 
which are generated on 150A with 1000 impules/kWh.

Values of the sensors are available on http://ip/csv.html 

The same script (ipswitch.sh) can be used to get the values from any of the 
following devices.

For every device you have to create an own configuration file, based on the
given ipswitch.conf.dist. You have to set the IPSWITCH variable to the 
ip address of the device.

Set GUID_N to the number of channels you want to use.

The GUID and CHANNEL have to be set depending on which IPswitch type you are 
using.

The entries of IPSwitch are numbered iC1, iC2, iC3 etc.

The conversation rate for impules to Wh has to be set on the IPSwitches.

You can optionally log the values into a CSV file and submit them later 
to the PVlng using submitcsv.sh
